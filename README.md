# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This page is a work day scheduler. It allows events to be entered in time blocks, saves them to local storage, and retrieves entered events from local storage to have them persist in their corresponding fields. Past, present, and future time blocks are color-coded.

## Installation

The website has been installed and deployed on [Github](https://github.com/).

## Usage

The user is presented with work day time blocks from 9 AM to 5 PM. Each time block is color-coded to represent if it is in the past (red), present (green),  or future (blue).

The user enters an event into a time block and clicks the "Add" button.  The event and corresponding time are saved in local storage, where they are retrieved to persist on page reload.

### Code Snippets

```

var today = moment();
$("#currentDay").text(today.format("MMMM Do, YYYY"));

```

This code block creates var "today" from the moment() snapshot. It then locates id "currentDay" in the HTML and assigns var "today" in the format "July 1st, 2022" as text.

```

$(".saveBtn").on("click", function() {
    var calEvent = $(this).siblings("textarea").val();
    var calEventTime = $(this).siblings(".hour").text();
    // saves to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem(calEventTime, calEvent);
})

```

This code block looks for any click of a button with the class of "saveBtn". It then creates variable "calEvent" by traversing to the button's sibling with the element "textarea" and pulling the value (the entered text). It also creates variable "calEventTime" by traversing to the button's sibling with the class of "hour" and pulling the text in that div. Finally, it saves these two variables as a key and property in localStorage.

```

var realHour = moment().format("H");

$(".hour").each(function (){
    var currentHour = parseInt($(this).attr("id").split("hour-")[1]);

if (currentHour < realHour) {
    $(this).siblings(".description").addClass("past"); 
}

else if (currentHour == realHour) {
    $(this).siblings(".description").addClass("present");
}

else if (currentHour > realHour) {
    $(this).siblings(".description").addClass("future");
}
})

```

This code block first pulls the current hour from the moment() snapshot and creates a variable called "realHour". The function then loops over each instance of class "hour" in the HTML, traverses to its corresponding id, parses the id value (example: "hour-9"), and splits "hour-" from the id value. It creates an array of the numerical value in the id; returns index[1] (the numerical value). It then saves the returned index[1] to variable "currentHour".

If var "currentHour" is less than var "realHour", each instance of "currentHour" will turn red to indicate it is in the past.

If var "currentHour" is equal to var "realHour", the row will turn green to indicate it is the present hour.

If var "currentHour" is greater than var "realHour", each instance of "currentHour" will turn blue to indicate it is in the future.

Military time is used for the hour id's because of the way moment.js pulls hour data for PM hours.

```

$("#hour-9").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("9 AM"));
$("#hour-10").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("10 AM"));
$("#hour-11").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("11 AM"));
$("#hour-12").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("12 PM"));
$("#hour-13").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("1 PM"));
$("#hour-14").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("2 PM"));
$("#hour-15").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("3 PM"));
$("#hour-16").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("4 PM"));
$("#hour-17").siblings("textarea").text(localStorage.getItem("5 PM"));

```

This code block allows the entered data to persist in each field on page reload.  Each line locates a specific id (example: "#hour-9), traverses to the sibling with element "textarea", and loads the property (var "CalEvent") from the corresponding key (var "calEventTime") in localStorage.
